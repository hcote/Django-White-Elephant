# surprise-me

This is a web application built on the django framework. Angular will be used for the front end. 
Users will join a group of a specific product category 
(books, coffee), and on a predetermined frequency (once a month), will send and receive an item. For example, I 
can sign up for a group where every month, for 3 months, I send another person in the group a book of my choosing, 
and a different person will send me a book of their choosing. It's an app that promotes sharing your hobbies and 
interests with others in a fun way.
